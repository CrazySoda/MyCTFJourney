In the realm of snow, where crystals softly descend,	      	      	  
A world transformed, a frozen magic blend.		 	 	   
The pass is cool, with whispers of the frost,       	    	      	    
A wintry tale, in the silence embossed.   				     
       	       	   	 	      	 	   	       	  
Blanketed fields in pristine white array,	       	   	       	    
Footprints tell stories, as travelers find their way.   	  	 
The pass is cool, a chill in the air,   	    	  		 
Nature's masterpiece, beyond compare.		      		       	 
  	   		  	    	    	      	   	     	  
Snowflakes pirouette, a ballet in the sky,     	       		    
As the pass is cool, under winter's lullaby.	     	 	      	      
Mountains wear blankets, adorned and bright,   	 	     	  	   
In the hush of the cold, a tranquil night.   	   	       	  	      
 	       	    	    	     	  	   	 
A moonlit serenade, where shadows dance,
The pass is cool, a frozen trance.
Nature's artwork in each delicate flake,
A symphony of stillness, a frozen lake.

Silent whispers, secrets untold,
In the pass so cool, where dreams unfold.
A canvas of white, where memories amass,
In the timeless beauty of the snow-filled pass.
